This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

The college application process is crazy! There is an overload of information and so many people to communicate your wants and needs with. After watching my sister go through this process recently, I was inspired to create a website that can help seniors come up with a criteria for what they want out of their college experience. This criteria then becomes a guide for their research, and helps them organise their thoughts in a tabular for that is easy to read and even share with their college counceler and parents.

This is a Next.js application.
This website is currently under development. 

The following features have been implemented:
- Landing page that prompts students to write a criteria for their college experience in the form of a list of words
- Convert list of words to the headers of a an editable table, which students can add thier research to.
- Store student's edits and headers in browser's localStorage

features yet to be implemented:
- Google sheet integration (inorder to export the table to google sheets)
- A survey of questions that can help prompt studnets to really think about what they want thier college experience to look like (locations, weather, social-life etc.)
